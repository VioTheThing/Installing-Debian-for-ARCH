**Hi There!**
You've come here because the software you so darely need on your Arch computer only exists as a .deb, yes? Well fear no more, As I'll show you how to Install this .Deb for Arch!

##      What do I need prior to this?
All you need is;

- your .deb file
> [!NOTE]
> incase the AUR (ArchLinux User Repository) does not have a prior repackaged repository.
  
- **SUDO privileges**
- **ROOT privileges**

#      Method 1; A priorly repackaged bin is available on the AUR
> [!NOTE]
> For Demonstration purposes, we are using the GameMaker installation files. at the time of writing this, the current Gamemaker debian file is **`GameMaker-Beta-2024.1400.0.849.deb`**. The Version number will be different than yours, so please check first.

###      1. Install yay using pacman.
      `sudo pacman -S yay`
> [!NOTE]
> yay is an AUR helper used to query & install AUR packages. In case the debian package has already been repackaged and published to the AUR by someone else.

###      2. Find your desired file on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).
for our purposes, it is [Gamemaker-beta-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gamemaker-beta-bin).

###      3. Install the package using yay.

> [!NOTE]
> This process will take a while, depending on your Internet speed.

  Raw command:
  
      `yay -S package-name`
      
  For Our Purposes: 
  
      `yay -S Gamemaker-beta-bin`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> press N when it asks you to show any extra files (such as the ToS).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> press Y when it asks you to install any needed repositories.

> [!WARNING]
> ## Once everything is installed, update everything once more using pacman or yay, to make sure no outdated repositories will hinder your repackage from running.

###      You should be good to go from here!
> [!NOTE]
> **If it doesnÂ´t show up, restart your PC and it should show up.**


#      METHOD 2
> [!NOTE]
>  Let's assume the Debian package hasn't been repackaged as an .PKG in AUR yet.

#      FAQ
##      Why can i not use the .deb file directly in Arch Linux?
- .deb files are specifically made to run on **DEBIAN** distributions.

##      I've found an easier way to do [X]!
- Great! If you want to, you can open an issue or a pull request.

##      "You can do [X] way easier if you do it with [Y]!"
- Cool! If you want to, you can open an issue or a pull request.

##      "Can you help me with [XY]?"
